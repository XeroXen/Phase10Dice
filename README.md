# Phase10Dice
Computer Science I Final Project

This was initially coded in December 2018. This class did not teach Object-oriented parts of the C++ language, so this is comprised solely of one class. While my abilities have improved since this project was made, it was still fun to make and I am proud of it.

It may be best to be familiar with the game of Phase 10 Dice beforehand, the rules are a little weird. It does explain to you how to win each phase, just make sure to pay attention to how the dice were generated before the game starts! I think if I were to expand on this console-based game, I would like to keep a constant reminder of the faces of each die for the player for the duration of play, so they do not have to scroll back.
